# Makefile for kbase-ui.
#
# The general flow is as follows:
# 1. Local development = just run 'make'
# 2. KBase deployment = run 'make && make deploy'
# (this might take a little configuration depending on the
# deployment location)
# 3. Run all tests = make test
#
# This Makefile is mostly here as a convenience to the devops
# crew. The actual build/test/deploy process is managed by
# Grunt (in a common JavaScript style), but some essential tasks
# are exposed here.

# set TARGET to use different deploy-*.cfg files (deploy-ci, deploy-prod, etc)
# currently only 'prod', 'ci', and 'next' are valid variables.

PACKAGE			= ui-common

# Note that this uses the default targets -- which are least disruptive (to production)
# and most experimental (development ui, ci services)

# Initialization here pulls in all dependencies from Bower and NPM.
# This is **REQUIRED** before any build process can proceed.
# bower install is not part of the build process, since the bower
# config is not known until the parts are assembled...

	cd tools/server; npm install
	grunt init
	
# Perform the build.
# The actual build step is done by grunt. This also sets up the 
# configuration in the build target. That configuration mainly
# deals with filling out templated URL targets based on deployment
# location (prod vs. next vs. CI vs. local)

# Installs tools into kbase-ui/dev. These tools are ignored by git,
# so may safely be modified by the developer. They are important but not 
# required by the dev process. More in the docs.
