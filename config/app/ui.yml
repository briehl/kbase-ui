    # Feature Switches are unique values (preferrably uuids) which indicate a single feature or
    # or group of features. The featureSwitch id may be used within code, kbase-ui or plugins, to
    # disable or enable code features.
    # The feature switch must be registered here, and then asserted as enabled, if desired, in a deploy
    # configuration.
    # The presence of a feature switch within the deploy config indicates that that switch is "on".
    # Code may check whether a feature is on or off.
    # If a feature is referenced without it being defined, an error is thrown.
    # Therefore integration testing is your friend.
