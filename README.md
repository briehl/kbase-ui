## About

The KBase User Interface ( *KBase UI* aka *kbase-ui* ) is a web browser Single Page App (SPA) providing tools for [KBase](http://kbase.us) users. It is a partner to the [KBase Narrative Interface](https://github.com/kbase/narrative), with which it shares code yet runs as a separate web app. Current user features include:

- *Dashboard*, for an overview of a user's narratives and activities, and those of their colleagues
- *User Profile*, for viewing any user profile and editing their own, 
- *Data Viewer*, for inspecting any data object a user has access to (aka "landing pages"),
- *Type Viewer*, for inspecting the attributes of any data type,
- *Authenticator*, for logging into and out of user's KBase Account and granting authorization to the web app.

> If you have stumbled up on this project, you may first want to [find out about KBase](http://kbase.us). 
> The *KBase UI* is not a general purpose tool -- it is designed to work inside the KBase ecosystem. 

The primary audience for this project is 

- *KBase Developers and Staff* - who need access to the kbase-ui for development, testing, deployment
- *KBase ContributorsAdvanced Users* - who are developing servivces and plugins for kbase-ui,
- *KBase Contributors* - who wish to know more about the architecture and "sausage making" of KBase.

Most KBase users will be exposed to the KBase UI by ... [using KBase](https://narrative.kbase.us) :)

## Installation

As a SPA, the KBase UI is "just" a collection of web browser assets. All you need to run it is a modern web browser, a web server, and an Internet connection.

At present there is no installable distribution of KBase UI. The essential process is to download the project, ensure you have the (widely available and free) prerequisite development tools, build the project (just a few seconds), and then use the built-in preview server to pull up the app.

Please see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for details.

However, in the context of a short readme document, I hope you can forgive us for jumping to the happy ending version:

```
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui
cd kbase-ui
make run
```

This will fetch and build the develop branch (bleeding edge) kbase-ui, start a small test server, and load your default browser pointing to the server.

If the develop branch, which is unstable but usually works, is not working, you may wish to skip the branch option, or inspect the github repo for a recent tagged release version.

When you are done ```make stop``` will kill the server.

For more complete instructions (which in turn have links to technical guides), please see:

- [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md)
- [Installation](docs/installation.md)
- [Deployment](docs/quick-deploy.md)

## Development

Please see the [Developer Guide](docs/development.md).
